# PetWM

PetWM is a petite tiling X window manager written in C using Xlib

## What are the goals of PetWM?

PetWM attempts to be a small window manager capable of doing all the
things you would expect from a tiling window manager with the addition
of having a easily approachable and highly customizable codebase.

Additionally the PetWM repository includes all the necessary utilities to
be paired with the window manager.
This is something many other window managers lack.
